## Description
I was tasked with transforming a fully functional Google Books API search engine, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API implemented with Apollo Server. The goal is to enhance the application's performance and responsiveness to evolving user demands. 

    1. Upon loading the search engine, users should see a menu with options for "Search for Books" and "Login/Signup," along with an input field and submit button for book searches.
    2. Clicking "Search for Books" reveals an input field and submit button for searches, presenting search results with book details when a term is entered.
    3. The "Login/Signup" menu option opens a modal with options to log in or sign up.
    4. When signing up, users provide a username, email, and password; when logging in, users enter email and password.
    5. Successful signup results in account creation and login, closing the modal.
    6. Logged-in users see menu options for "Search for Books," viewing saved books, and logout.
    7. Logged-in users can search for books, save them to their account, and view a list of saved books.
    8. Users can remove a book from their saved list and log out of the site.
    9. Logging out presents the initial menu with search options and login/signup fields.

By refactoring the existing codebase, I gained insights into the advantages of GraphQL, such as efficient data fetching and increased flexibility for clients. Additionally, the deployment to Render and integration with MongoDB Atlas provide practical exposure to real-world deployment scenarios and database management. Completing this assignment offers valuable hands-on experience in transitioning a web application from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server within the MERN stack.
